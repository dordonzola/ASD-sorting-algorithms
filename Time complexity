Sorting algorithms:

bubble                          always n^2
selection                       always n^2
insertion                       n^2, n^2, n
merge                           n*log(n)
quick                           n^2, n*log(n), n*log(n)
radix                           always d(n+k)
(*d-amount of letters in keys,
 k-amount of different numbers)

heap                            always n*log(n)
counting                        always n+k
(k*-range)
bucket                          n^2, n + n^2/k* + k, n (when k~=n)
(*k-nuber of buckets)

Different algorithms:

binary search                   log(n), log(n), 1
median of medians               always n
quickselect                     n^2, n, n
